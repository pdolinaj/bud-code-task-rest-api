# bud-code-task-rest-api
Rest API to solve a coding task for BUD tech test

### Bud - Code Task (PHP)

This is a two part task, which should take you a maximum of 2 hours to complete. Frameworks are optional. Code without frameworks is preferred.
When you have completed the task, please send via a Zip files or Github link to ​talent@thisisbud.com​ with the title “COMPLETED TASK - PHP - ​*insert your name*​”

### Task Part 1 (page 2) - API Consumption.
In this task we are looking to see how you would connect to the API given the specifications in the below documentation.
### Task Part 2 (page 3) - Data Processing.
In this task we are interested to understand your approach to OOP and Unit Testing.
 
## Task Part 1.
You are R2D2 and you have to download part of the Imperial Operating System’s Cybersecurity Center of Excellence API.

The base url is ​https://death.star.api/​ ​(*Not a valid URL)

The endpoints are:
- /token This endpoint accepts POST requests.
- /reactor/exhaust/1, this endpoint accepts DELETE requests only.
- /prison/lea, this endpoint accepts GET requests only.

Each connection to the system requires an oauth2 token, for the purposes of this exercise this token does not expire, but you will have to get it from the token endpoint.

The system requires an ssl certificate and key to be sent with every request, including token.

## Task Part 2
As witty astromech droid, you will be called on by witless humans to hack complicated defence systems on a fly. So you have decided to mock the response as a series of ​unit tests​. Long before you arrive at the death star. These tests should cover success and failure. You know that each endpoint will be Droidspeak(Binary). You will need to process this and return in galactic basic (english). Write a service to undertake this.
Get response for the /prisoner/leia, {
"cell": "01000011 01100101 01101100 01101100 00100000 00110010 00110001 00111000 00110111",
"block": "01000100 01100101 01110100 01100101 01101110 01110100 01101001 01101111 01101110 00100000 01000010 01101100 01101111 01100011 01101011 00100000 01000001 01000001 00101101 00110010 00110011 00101100"
